## Disability & Discussion - February 2020

![Disability & Discussion Logo](/img/DisabilityDiscussionPrint.svg "Disability & Discussion Logo")

In February 2020, I was tasked with creating a logo for a new support group at the Affirmations LGBTQIA+ support center in Ferndale, MI. This support group would be intended to provide a safe, meaningful environment for disabled LGBTQIA+ community members.

My goal was to create a logo that would immediately stand out as promoting accessibility and queer inclusivity. In order to promote the accessibility-centric focus, I decided to style the logo after designs commonly found in the world of U.S. federal accessibility promotion. The final product used both the modified International Symbol of Access from the [Accessible Icon Project](http://accessibleicon.org/) and [the Philadelphia Pride 2017 iteration of the ubiquitous Rainbow Pride flag.](https://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/06/08/philly-pride-flag-black-brown/) The background color is **#00537b,** a color that is immediately evocative of accessibility-centric designs, and the font is a slightly modified **Alte DIN 1451 Mittelschrift gepraegt,** a free font whose variants are often [used to convey information for transport authorities in Germany, the Czech Republic, Greece, Singapore, and the city of Los Angeles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_signage_typefaces)
